  <header class="title">Benefits of using dynamically loaded translation components</header>

  <section>
    Working with the typescript compiler provides us with convenient and reliable tools right out of the box.<br/>
    We can define an interface for our translation object and automatically have the following benefits:
  <ul>
    <li>The language text in the language components have the correct structure according to the language text interface</li>
    <li>All references in our code and templates to the language text are safe and points to existing keys</li>
    <li>Intellisense in our code and templates</li>
    <li>Smaller bundle size since Angular's builtin tools are used</li>
    <li>Language components are lazy loaded so they will be loaded only the first time they are required</li>
    <li>Flexibility when coding the language text, it is a javascript object and not JSON so you can do things like:
<pre>
  readonly COMPANY_NAME = 'Xavilon Ltd.';
  appText: AppText = {{'{'}}
     companyName: this.COMPANY_NAME,
     copyright: `Â© 2021 {{'{'}}this.COMPANY_NAME}.  All rights reserved.`
}
</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
