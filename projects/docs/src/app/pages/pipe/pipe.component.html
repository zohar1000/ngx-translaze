  TranslazePipe is used to display a tokenized string as a string with values, it is useful for cases
  where values are known only at run time.<br/>

  The pipe is being passed a string containing tokens, each token is wrapped with {{'{'}}}, it also being
  passed a parameter which is an object containing tokens/value pairs.<br/><br/>

  In the following example, the properties <b>userName</b> and <b>age</b> are initialized asynchronously.
  <td-flavored-markdown [copyCodeToClipboard]="true" [copyCodeTooltips]="copyCodeTooltips">
    {{ mdClass }}
  </td-flavored-markdown>

  those properties are passed to the pipe as parameters, the following
  <td-flavored-markdown [copyCodeToClipboard]="true" [copyCodeTooltips]="copyCodeTooltips">
    {{ mdTemplate }}
  </td-flavored-markdown>
