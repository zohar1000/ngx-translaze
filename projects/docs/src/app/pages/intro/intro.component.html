  ngx-translaze makes it safe and easy to develop multi lingual angular apps.<br/><br/>
  App development is made over time and it is hard to avoid human mistakes once a while which cause run time errors.<br/>
  ngx-translaze was designed to provide multi lingual capabilities while preventing such errors.<br/><br/>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <ul>The steps to implement multi lingual:
    <li>create an interface of your language text structure</li>
    <li>create a component for each language and declare a variable to hold the language text.<br/>
      the variable will have the type of the language text interface</li>
    <li>in your application components declare a variable which will reference the language text</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="sum-line-hl">Your template have now access to a typed language text!</div>
  <!--The components are lazy loaded, so each language will be loaded only on demand.-->
</section>

<section>
  <br/><h2>Example</h2>
  The example demonstrates how to implement an 'about' page.<br/>
  The page will have a title and short description, both using language text.
  <div class="section-inner-title">The interface</div>
  We will declare an interface for the language text structure named <i>AppText</i><br/>
  <div class="note">Note that the names of interfaces, components and variables used in this example are arbitrary, you can choose your own names.</div>
  <td-flavored-markdown [copyCodeToClipboard]="true" [copyCodeTooltips]="copyCodeTooltips">
    {{ mdTextInterface }}
  </td-flavored-markdown>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="section-inner-title">The language component</div>
  Each language text will be contained in a component, this is a regular angular component that will be lazy loaded by ngx-translaze on demand.<br/>
  A variable having the type of <i>AppText</i> will contain the language text, english in this case.<br/>
  <td-flavored-markdown [copyCodeToClipboard]="true" [copyCodeTooltips]="copyCodeTooltips">
    {{ mdVariable }}
  </td-flavored-markdown>
</section>

<div class="block-quote">
  When developing a multi lingual app we work with multiple language components.<br/>
  During development we modify the text in our language components and we might make mistakes which can lead to run time errors.<br/>
  For example we might not keep a language text consistent with the interface by forgetting to add a new key, or we may add
  a key to a wrong node, or we might update the language components with new keys but miss updating one of the language components.<br/><br/>

  <div class="emp">Benefit #1 - automatic language text integrity</div>

  Having an interface and a corresponding typed variable for each language component ensures integrity of the text structure
  between all oue language components.<br/>
  This is automatically done for us by the typescript compiler at build time.
</div>

<section>
  <div class="section-inner-title">The about component</div>
  Now in our about component we will declare a class variable appText$, this will be a BehaviourSubject typed <i>AppText</i>,  this variable
  will be used in our template.
  <td-flavored-markdown [copyCodeToClipboard]="true" [copyCodeTooltips]="copyCodeTooltips">
    {{ mdComponentVariable }}
  </td-flavored-markdown>

  ngx-translaze provides a simple one-liner method to assign the language text to this variables, actually there are multiple ways
  for your choice, those will be described later on.<br/>
  Lets assume for now that appText$ already contains the text.
  <div id="template" class="section-inner-title">The template</div>
  Since the language text is lazy loaded we need to make sure the text was loaded before using it, so we will
  wrap our template with *ngIf.<br/>
  For convenience, we can refer the language text with a template variable, we called it here <i>appText</i>.<br/><br/>
  The IDE now provides intellisense when we refer the language text in our template.<br/>
  <img class="desc-image" src="assets/images/intellisense.gif" alt="intellisense"/>
</section>

<div class="block-quote">
  <div class="emp">Benefit #2 - intellisense</div>
  As you can see from the image above, it is much easier to develop with intellisense.

  <hr/>

  During development we might modify the language text interface but forget to modify our templates accordingly.<br/><br/>
  For example, we might change a key name from 'productName' to 'brandName'.<br/>
  We then change the references in our templates to the new key, but we might <b>miss</b> one or or more references and still have something like: appText.general.productName
  instead of appText.general.brandName.<br/><br/>

  <div class="emp">Benefit #3 - automatic template integrity with text</div>
  During build, the typescript compiler verifies that the references in the templates match the text interface.<br/><br/>
  <b>We are safe from any run time errors that might happen due to human errors.</b>
</div>
