  ngx-translaze makes it safe and easy to develop multi lingual angular apps.<br/><br/>

  Implementation is made via components and interfaces, rather than json files.<br/>
  The language text itself is defined by an interface, which enables the typescript compiler to automatically
  catch errors and provide intellisense as you develop.<br/><br/>

  Having the language text defined by an interface protects us from making errors when we refer to it from our templates
  and components.<br/>
  such errors can be caused by modifying keys, moving keys, having to synchronize the
  structure across multiple languages, and so on.<br/>
  It is safe and reliable approach since changes are made to the code throughout the life of the app and it is hard
  to avoid human mistakes.<br/>
  ngx-translaze is designed to protect us from such errors.
  <br/><br/>

  <ul>By using Angular's built-in tools, components and interfaces, we are being automatically provided with those benefits:
    <li>error checking by the typescript compiler in our classes and templates, making it safe in case we use incorrect keys</li>
    <li>intellisense in our classes and templates</li>
    <li>it is easier to maintain language text in components rather than json files</li>
    <li>the bundle size is small since Angular's built-in tools are used</li>
    <li>language components are lazy loaded</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <ul>The steps to implement multi lingual:
    <li>create an interface of your language text structure</li>
    <li>create a component for each language and declare a variable to hold the language text.<br/>
      the variable will have the type of the language text interface</li>
    <li>in your app module, import NgxTranslate module and pass it a config object where you define a default language.<br/>
      the module
    </li>
    <li>in a component you want to use the translation declare a variable that will reference the language text</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="sum-line-hl">Your template have now access to a typed language text!</div>
-->

  <!--The components are lazy loaded, so each language will be loaded only on demand.-->

  <br/><h2>Example</h2>
  The example demonstrates how to implement an 'about' page.<br/>
  The page will have a title that will be displayed from the language text.
  <div class="section-inner-title">The interface</div>
  We will declare an interface for the language text structure named <i>AppText</i><br/>
  <div class="note">Note that the names of interfaces, components and variables used in this example are arbitrary, you can choose your own names.</div>
  <td-flavored-markdown [copyCodeToClipboard]="true" [copyCodeTooltips]="copyCodeTooltips">
    {{ mdTextInterface }}
  </td-flavored-markdown>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="section-inner-title">The language component</div>
  Each language text will be contained in a component, this is a regular angular component that will be lazy loaded by ngx-translaze on demand.<br/>
  A variable having the type of <i>AppText</i> will contain the language text, english in this case.<br/>
  <td-flavored-markdown [copyCodeToClipboard]="true" [copyCodeTooltips]="copyCodeTooltips">
    {{ mdVariable }}
  </td-flavored-markdown>
</section>

<div class="block-quote">
  When developing a multi lingual app we work with multiple language components.<br/>
  During development we modify the text in our language components and we might make mistakes which can lead to run time errors.<br/>
  For example, we might not keep a language text consistent with the interface by forgetting to add a new key, or we may add
  a key to a wrong node, or we might update the language components with new keys but miss updating one of the language components.<br/><br/>

  <div class="emp">Benefit #1 - automatic language text integrity</div>

  All language components contains the text in a variable typed as <i>AppText</i> which ensures that our
  language text structure is consistent across all language components.<br/>

  This is automatically done for us by the typescript compiler at build time.
</div>

<section>
  <div class="section-inner-title">The about component</div>
  Now in our about component we will declare a class variable appText$, this will be a BehaviourSubject typed as <i>AppText</i>, this variable
  will be used in our template.<br/>

  Next is to assign the app text to our variables from the <b>text$</b> observable in ngx-translaze service.<br/>

<!--
  To assign the app text to our variable we will inject ngx-translate service and assign the app text to our variable from the text$

  We will inject ngx-translate service to have the app text assigned

  ngx-translaze provides a few ways to assign the language text to the variable.<br/>
  We will show here how the text is assigned via ngx-translate injected service.-->
  <td-flavored-markdown [copyCodeToClipboard]="true" [copyCodeTooltips]="copyCodeTooltips">
    {{ mdComponentVariable }}
  </td-flavored-markdown>
  <div class="sum-line-hl">Your template have now access to a typed language text!</div>
</section>

<section>
  <div id="template" class="section-inner-title">The template</div>
  Since the language text is lazy loaded we need to make sure the text was loaded before we use it, so we will
  wrap our template with *ngIf.<br/>
  For convenience, we can refer the language text with a template variable, we name it here <i>appText</i>.<br/><br/>
  The IDE now provides intellisense when we refer the language text in our template.<br/>

<div class="block-quote">
  <div class="emp">Benefit #2 - intellisense</div>
  As you can see from the image above, it is much easier to develop with intellisense.

  <hr/>

  During development we might modify the language text interface but forget to modify our templates accordingly.<br/><br/>
  For example, we might change a key name from 'productName' to 'brandName'.<br/>
  We then change the references in our templates to the new key, but we might <b>miss</b> one or or more references and still have something like: appText.general.productName
  instead of appText.general.brandName.<br/><br/>

  <div class="emp">Benefit #3 - automatic template integrity with text</div>
  During build, the typescript compiler verifies that the references in the templates match the text interface.<br/><br/>
  <b>We are safe from any run time errors that might happen due to human errors.</b>
