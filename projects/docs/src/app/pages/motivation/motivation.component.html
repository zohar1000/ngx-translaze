  When developing an angular project having multilingual support, I found 3 main libraries to work with, each has its pros and cons.
</section>

<ul>
  <li>
    <section>
      <div class="title"><a href="https://angular.io/guide/i18n">Official angular i18n (internationalization) library</a></div>
        Angular provides a translation library which works by placing a directive and an description at each dom element you want to translate.<br>
        During build, it generates a file which include all the elements having the directive in .xlif (a standard translation file)<br>
        This file can be sent to translators to be translated to the different languages.

      Cons: the template gets verbose, for example the line
      <td-flavored-markdown [copyCodeToClipboard]="true" [copyCodeTooltips]="copyCodeTooltips">
        {{ codeAngularI18nPre }}
      </td-flavored-markdown>
      turns into
      <td-flavored-markdown [copyCodeToClipboard]="true" [copyCodeTooltips]="copyCodeTooltips">
        {{ codeAngularI18nPost }}
      </td-flavored-markdown>
    </section>
  </li>

  <li>
    <section>
      <div class="title"><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/library/@ngx-translate/core">@ngx-translate</a></div>
      This library is here since angular version 2.0 and make use of language json files.<br>
      It is a robust library which provides directive, pipe and a service to work in your template and class.<br>
      Referring a nested key in the json file is made via string.

    <section>
      Provided a json file
      <td-flavored-markdown [copyCodeToClipboard]="true" [copyCodeTooltips]="copyCodeTooltips">
        {{ codeNgxTranslationPre }}
      </td-flavored-markdown>

      You can use either a directive
<!--      <pre><code [highlight]="codeNgxTranslationPost1"></code></pre>-->
      <td-flavored-markdown [copyCodeToClipboard]="true" [copyCodeTooltips]="copyCodeTooltips">
        {{ codeNgxTranslationPost1 }}
      </td-flavored-markdown>
      or a pipe
<!--      <pre><code [highlight]="codeNgxTranslationPost2"></code></pre>-->
      <td-flavored-markdown [copyCodeToClipboard]="true" [copyCodeTooltips]="copyCodeTooltips">
        {{ codeNgxTranslationPost2 }}
      </td-flavored-markdown>
    </section>
  </li>

  <li>
    <section>
      <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/ngneat/transloco/">Transloco</a></div>
      A relatively new and very powerful library, it also uses language json files.<br>
      Apart from a directive, pipe and service, it has also support for multiple languages simultaneously, testing, localization and more.<br>
      Referring a nested key is made via string as well, and you can refer to other keys in the json file during translation.
    </section>
    <section>
      Provided a json file
<!--      <pre><code [highlight]="codeTranslocoFile"></code></pre>-->
      <td-flavored-markdown [copyCodeToClipboard]="true" [copyCodeTooltips]="copyCodeTooltips">
        {{ codeTranslocoFile }}
      </td-flavored-markdown>
      You can use a structural directive
      <td-flavored-markdown [copyCodeToClipboard]="true" [copyCodeTooltips]="copyCodeTooltips">
        {{ codeTranslocoDirective1 }}
      </td-flavored-markdown>
      or an attribute directive
      <td-flavored-markdown [copyCodeToClipboard]="true" [copyCodeTooltips]="copyCodeTooltips">
        {{ codeTranslocoDirective2 }}
      </td-flavored-markdown>
      or a pipe
      <td-flavored-markdown [copyCodeToClipboard]="true" [copyCodeTooltips]="copyCodeTooltips">
        {{ codeTranslocoPipe }}
      </td-flavored-markdown>
    </section>
  </li>
</ul>

  Both transloco and @ngx-translate are fine libraries which are suited for large projects.<br/>
  The main con of both is using strings to refer to the keys in the json file.<br/>
  When working with a code base for a long time as we do with our application, it is inevitable to have changes
  made to our code relating to the translation. since the path to the keys in the json files utilizes strings, then
  the responsibility to maintain integrity between the code and all the language files is based on a human factor.<br/>
  This arises a few issues which can lead to runtime errors:
  <ul>
    <li>The string can refer to a non existing key. it can be made by a typo or by moving the key to a different node while forgetting
    to update the referring string in the class/template. this can lead to runtime errors.</li>
    <li>You need to make sure the language files are fully consistent in their structure with each other, this can be done via a prebuild
    script, so it is a step to add for the build process.</li>
    <li>json files cannot have comments which are useful for clarification, especially when sending language files to translators.</li>
    <li>for a given key, when we want to combine in its translation another key's translation, it is currently possible only if both
      are on the same node.</li>
  </ul>

  ngx-translaze was developed to solve the above issues by using dynamically loaded language components instead of json files.<br/>
  Working with the typescript compiler provides us with convenient and reliable tools right out of the box, the compiler automatically
  checks for translation integrity and provides us with intellisense.<br/>
